# Project prompts

User prompts are recorded verbatim below, in conversation order.

## Prompt 1: Define Game Documentation

We are going to implement the board game "Beyond The Sun" in the same style as ../pantheon. You may also look at ../roborally and ../istanbul for examples of how I want to build this. Write a README.md, VISION.md, RULES_SUMMARY.md, E2E_GUIDE.md, and UX_DESIGN.md for review before we start building anything.

## Prompt 2: Require Step Helper

The E2E guide needs the test step helper defined and required.

## Prompt 3: Illustrate UX Design

UX_DESIGN needs the images, not just a text description of the look of the game.

## Prompt 4: Publish Documentation PR

review ../deepsea for PROMPTS.md rules; create similar rules for this project. The current files are now the plan of record. Use gh to make a new github repository and put up the initial documentation as PR1 for review, after removing any verbiage about this being tentative/not approved. the gh repository should be public, gplv3, and I will look at the initial PR as soon as you push it up.

## Prompt 5: Simplify Tabletop Play

Is there any private information in the game? I didn't think so. If not, there should be no QR code for joining tabletop and no private device involved at all. Update the PR accordingly or rebut me if I am incorrect.

## Prompt 6: Scaffold Tracer Milestones

OK I have rebased and merged this. Write IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, focused on making a series of logical tracer-bullet style commits; meaning that each commit creates one user-story style e2e test that shows the UI with the user clicking on it and every state chagne captured with a screenshot, validating that a real user can complete that user story, backed by emulators in the e2e tests and supported by a PR preview link in the PR that allows manual testing against the production firestore database (which you'll hvae to create and configure, and each PR will have to update the rules as part of the PR preview process). Do not gate PR preview on e2e test completion, so that manual testing can proceed in parallel with the PR clearing its merge gates. Put up a new PR with the implementation plan for review, and a basic scaffold demonstrating the first tracer-bullet milestone from the plan.

## Prompt 7: Durable Production Tracers

I want to be able to switch between PR and production on the same game for recovery purposes, so don't store the data in different places. The e2e tests may be more than one per commit to demonstrate the flow in different interfaces (desktop web pvp, phone web pvp, tabletop). the live preview should post a link to the PR when it is up so that it can be found from the PR. Shared table joining should be direclty from the table surface like it is in pantheon; so the current PR is no good because it demonstrates a flow that won't exist in the real game: never implement flows that won't survive to production, a proper tracer bullet isn't just an end to end test of "some" functionality, it is an end to end demonstration of the desired produciton functionality, we don't want to have to re-implement anything later. let's redo this initial milestone and rewrite any wrong steps in the plan with these constraints in mind.
